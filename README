Code7 Responsive Accordion Module is a Joomla 1.6+ accordion module that uses jQuery to display articles in a responsive and, frankly, good looking module.

Features:
- Ability to load in jQuery with noconflict so that you're lovely mootools modules/components keep on truckin'.
- Displays articles from a selected category.
- Choose to limit the amount of articles.
- Order by recent first, ascending/descending by ID or randomly.

It's a simple module and we're not hiding that, it's lovely, it's to the point and it's simple to use.

Based on the awesome work at http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/10/12/flexible-slide-to-top-accordion/.
